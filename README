AI::ExpertSystem::Simple - A class implementing an expert system

This is release V1.00 of AI::ExpertSystem::Simple. The class 
implements a simple expert system that reads it knowledge base 
(set of IF .. THEN rules) from an XML file.

Three sample knowledge bases are provided along with a command line shell
that allows the knowledge bases to be consulted.

INSTALLATION

 % perl Makefile.PL
 % make
 % make test
 % sudo make install

TEST FAILURES

The tests are there to make sure that I have broken nothing when I
fiddle with the code and will teach you very little about how to use
the code. 

To see how to use the code look at simpleshell in the bin directory
and read the contents of the docs directory (when I have written them).

I am assuming that you know what an expert system is and know why 
you are even running this code for in the first place.

TO DO

* More documentation (you can never have too much)
* Implement the reset method (I know what this means)
* Tk based simpleshell
* Event logging

REQUIREMENTS

* Developed under 5.6.1 but should work on anything 5+.
* Written completely in Perl. XS is not required.
* Requires XML::Twig to parse the XML
